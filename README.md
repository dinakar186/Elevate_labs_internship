# Elevate Labs Internship – Data Analysis Portfolio
Welcome to my Elevate Labs internship repo! This repository contains individual tasks and projects I am working on during my internship journey.

## Repo Structure

Each task is organized inside its own folder named like `task1_files`, `task2_files`, etc. Inside each folder, you’ll find:
- Datasets : Raw and cleaned data files used for analysis.  
- Approach : Python notebooks or scripts detailing the data cleaning, analysis, or modeling steps.  
- Supporting Files : Any summaries, reports, or documentation related to the task.

## Current Task
-> task1_files -- Data cleaning and preprocessing using Pandas in Python (including notebook, raw and cleaned datasets, and a summary report).

## Tools & Environment

- Python (Pandas, NumPy)  
- Google Colab  
- Git & GitHub for version control

Feel free to explore each folder to see my step-by-step approach to solving the tasks!
